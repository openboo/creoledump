= creoledump =

A command-line program to process input as //WikiCreole// and translate it to valid HTML.

===Conventions used in this document:===

* **this** is used to indicate a **program**, **file**, or **folder**.
* //this// is used to indicate a //searchable keyword//.
* {{{this}}} is used to indicate an {{{exact command or path}}}.

== Project Summary ==

This project started with this simple premise: //WikiCreole// is a simple-yet-powerful markdown language for formatting much more than just wiki pages. It could be used to format notes, todo lists, README files, project files, or anything else - **if only** it was just as easy to translate //WikiCreole// to HTML as it is to write the file in //WikiCreole// in the first place. So the goal of this project was to create a versatile command-line program that can be used to quickly and easily translate //WikiCreole// to HTML in almost any situation.

# The command {{{creoledump inputfile}}} should translate the **inputfile** from //WikiCreole// into HTML and dump it into a default HTML file.
# The command {{{creoledump inputfile outputfile}}} should translate the **inputfile** from //WikiCreole// into HTML and dump it into the specified HTML file: **outputfile**.
# It should have an HTML template included, with a header and footer, so that the HTML generated by this command is a fully //valid HTML// page with CSS included for readability. (see [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]])
# It should have options to produce HTML with or without the header and footer of the HTML template.
# It should have options to produce the components of the HTML template with or without content.
# It should be able to use //pipes// to translate from //WikiCreole// to HTML "on the fly".
# It should have a method of easily producing //page jump// links, or //anchor links//, within the page.

== Usage Specifications ==

{{{creoledump --help}}}

Display help and exit.

**Test?** Success.\\**Problems:** Ignores extra arguments

{{{creoledump inputfile}}}

# Translate //WikiCreole// from **inputfile** into HTML.
# Include header and footer from the [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] in the HTML.
# Write the HTML to file {{{~/.creoledump/index.html}}}
# Also print HTML to //STDOUT//.
# Exit.

**Test?** Success.

{{{creoledump inputfile outputfile}}}

# Translate //WikiCreole// from **inputfile** into HTML.
# Include header and footer from the [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] in the HTML.
# Write the HTML to file {{{outputfile}}}
# Also print HTML to //STDOUT//.
# Exit.

**Test?** Success.\\**Problems:** Ignores extra arguments

{{{cat inputfile | creoledump}}}

# Translate //WikiCreole// from **inputfile** into HTML.
# Include header and footer from the [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] in the HTML.
# Write the HTML to file {{{~/.creoledump/index.html}}}
# Also print HTML to //STDOUT//.
# Exit.

**Test?** Success.

{{{cat inputfile | creoledump outputfile}}}

This is a tricky usage because it doesn't stick to the original specs for non-pipe interaction. The first option is **outputfile** instead of **inputfile** but it knows the difference because it is receiving content through the pipe.

# Translate //WikiCreole// from **inputfile** into HTML.
# Include header and footer from the [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] in the HTML.
# Write the HTML to file {{{outputfile}}}
# Also print HTML to //STDOUT//.
# Exit.

**Test?** Success.\\**Problems:** Ignores extra arguments

{{{creoledump --naked inputfile}}}

# Translate //WikiCreole// from **inputfile** into HTML.
# Also print HTML to //STDOUT//.
# Exit.
# --Include header and footer from the [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] in the HTML.--
# --Write the HTML to file {{{~/.creoledump/index.html}}}--

**Test?** Success.

{{{creoledump --naked inputfile outputfile}}}

# Translate //WikiCreole// from **inputfile** into HTML.
# Write the HTML to file {{{outputfile}}}
# Also print HTML to //STDOUT//.
# Exit.
# --Include header and footer from the [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] in the HTML.--

**Test?** Success.\\**Problems:** Ignores extra arguments

{{{cat inputfile | creoledump --naked}}}

# Translate //WikiCreole// from **inputfile** into HTML.
# Also print HTML to //STDOUT//.
# Exit.
# --Include header and footer from the [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] in the HTML.--
# --Write the HTML to file {{{~/.creoledump/index.html}}}--

**Test?** Success.

{{{cat inputfile | creoledump --naked outputfile}}}

# Translate //WikiCreole// from **inputfile** into HTML.
# Write the HTML to file {{{outputfile}}}
# Also print HTML to //STDOUT//.
# Exit.
# --Include header and footer from the [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] in the HTML.--

**Test?** {{{FAIL!}}}\\**Problems:** No output file generated.

{{{ creoledump --quiet inputfile}}}
**Test?** Success.
{{{ creoledump --quiet inputfile outputfile}}}
**Test?** Success.\\**Problems:** Ignores extra arguments
{{{ cat inputfile | creoledump --quiet}}}
**Test?** Success.
{{{ cat inputfile | creoledump --quiet outputfile}}}
**Test?** Success.\\**Problems:** Ignores extra arguments

Works as expected, except without printing anything to //STDOUT//.

{{{creoledump --head}}}

**Test?** Success.

# Print HTML header from [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] to //STDOUT//.

{{{creoledump --foot}}}

**Test?** Success.

# Print HTML footer from [[#HTML Template|HTML Template]] to //STDOUT//.

== HTML Template ==

By default, the output HTML is themed with an HTML template, which places the content of **head.txt** above the translated HTML and the content from **foot.txt** below. The style file linked to in **head.txt** is **style.css**.

* These HTML template files can be found in whatever folder you installed **creoledump**, typically {{{~/.creoledump/}}}
* The template includes **style.css** which also uses the font from the **webfonts** folder.
* The header and footer of the HTML template can be excluded using the command {{{creoledump --naked}}}
* The header of the HTML template can be output to //STDOUT// using the command {{{creoledump --head}}}
* The footer of the HTML template can be output to //STDOUT// using the command {{{creoledump --foot}}}
* Both the header and footer of the HTML template can be output to //STDOUT// without any content by using the command {{{creoledump}}} without any options.

=== template files: ===

* **head.txt**
* **foot.txt**
* **style.css**
* **webfonts/* **

== Installation ==

# Navigate to the folder where you are installing **creoledump**.\\It is typically installed in {{{~/.creoledump/}}} which you can make with:\\{{{mkdir ~/.creoledump/}}}
# Move **creoledump.tar** into this folder using:\\{{{mv ~/Downloads/creoledump.tar ~/.creoledump/.}}}
# Unzip **creoledump.tar** in this folder using:\\{{{tar -xf creoledump.tar}}}
# To add **creoledump** to your path you can simply use:\\{{{sudo ln -s creoledump ~/bin/.}}} as long as {{{~/bin/.}}} is in your **$PATH**. ([[How to add to $PATH***]])
# Now **creoledump** should be available to you anywhere on the computer. Unless your file permissions are messed up somehow.

== Known Issues ==

* The ~ just doesn't show up, sometimes... such as in the filepath ~/bin/
** The current workaround is that it always shows up properly in the preformatting tag, as in: {{{~/bin/}}}

== Ideas for the Future ==

* Add a way to specify an HTML template other than the default?
